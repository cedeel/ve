Vé
==

Vé is an editor for translating gettext PO files on Android. It is still in an early development phase, so you might still experience bugs and missing features. If you do, you are very welcome to help out by reporting the bug or missing feature through Vé's issue tracker.

PO files are the de-facto standard for localization (translation) of especially open source programs that run on several platforms, including Linux, Windows and MacOS, but also Android apps may be localized by means of PO files (including this very app).

Vé enables you to load such a PO file into a simple interface, fully (or partially) translate apps or programs into your own language, and save an updated PO file for implementation by the app/program developer. While providing the essential features for translation and localization of apps and programs, Vé is simple in design to compensate for the limitations of a mobile platform like Android (small screen, no physical keyboard, etc.)

Vé is named after one of [Odin's two brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vili_and_V%C3%A9) in Norse mythology. The three brothers, Odin, Vili and Vé were thought to be the Gods who gave life to the first humans, Ask and Embla. Vé was the one who gave them speech, among other capabilities.

Vé is open source software, released under the GPL licence, which means you can use it for free, for personal or other purposes. You can even redistribute it, modified or not, provided you do so under the same licence, which means you have to provide your source files for any changes. You can read the [full licence text here](https://github.com/pryds/ve/blob/master/COPYING).

Contributing to Vé
------------------

As with much other open source software, Vé is based on voluntary work. If you want, you can contribute to the development of Vé. This might be either through reporting bugs in the issue tracker, contributing code, translating Vé into your own language, and/or donating an amount of your choice. Generally, code contributions (except translations) are accepted through Github pull requests.

If you want to help by providing a translation of Vé into your language, I ask you to have a bit of patience, still. Translations are to be handled by The Translation Project, via PO files. You can, of course, use Vé to translate Vé, or you can use a PO editor for desktop computers, such as [lokalize](http://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize)
or [poedit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/). Translations will be possible a while before the first version of Vé is released.

Donations of any amount that you see fit are kindly accepted through Bitcoin address 12FPDWwNYyn6wRfybncM5VcJpM4ZP6QNnM. At some point in the future, in-app donations through Google Play will be possible.

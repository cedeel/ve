Vé
==

Vé is (going to be) an editor for translating gettext PO files on Android. It is still in a very early development phase; so much that it is still practically unusable.

Vé is named after one of [Odin's two brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vili_and_V%C3%A9) in Norse mythology. The three brothers, Odin, Vili and Vé were thought to be the Gods who gave life to the first humans, Ask and Embla. Vé was the one who gave them speech, among other capabilities.
